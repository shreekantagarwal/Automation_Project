We have created an automation script. When initialized, it first updates all the packages in the system. After that it would track if Apache2 service is installed or not. If it is installed, it would check if Apache2 service is enable and running. If it is not enabled, the script would enable it. However, if Apache is not installed, Apache2 would be installed and we make sure that the service is enabled. After this we make sure that we create a .tar file for the access and error logs and upload it to S3.
